Plastic Waste Classification Using CNN:

This project focuses on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images of plastic waste into various categories. The aim is to contribute to waste management and environmental conservation by providing a tool to automate the sorting process of plastic materials.

Key Features:

Dataset: A curated dataset containing labeled images of different types of plastic waste.
Model Architecture: A CNN model designed for accurate image classification.
Goal: Enhance efficiency in waste sorting and promote effective recycling processes.
