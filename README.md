# Project Description


This project focuses on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images of plastic waste into various categories. The aim is to contribute to waste management and environmental conservation by providing a tool to automate the sorting process of plastic materials.

Key Features:

- Dataset: A curated dataset containing labeled images of different types of plastic waste.
  You can access the dataset here: [Waste Classification Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data).
  
- Model Architecture: A CNN model designed for accurate image classification.
- Goal: Enhance efficiency in waste sorting and promote effective recycling processes.

Objective:

- Classify different types of plastic waste (e.g., plastic bottles, bags, containers) using deep learning techniques.
- Contribute to the environmental cause by automating plastic waste detection and facilitating recycling processes.
